      Time Tracker was originally a coding challenge. The company that issued the challenge 
      creates software for financial instutions, so I modeled the UI upon my own experience
      working at a credit union. <br/>The software tellers interacted with was grey, which may 
      seem to reflect poor design, but the majority of the windows and components were rounded,
      which I imagine represented a "free spirit" like nature.
